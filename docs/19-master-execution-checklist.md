# Apna Ghar — Master Execution Checklist

**Repository:** `Yashpal568/apna-ghar`  
**Working branch:** `feat/m1-foundation-completion`  
**Last updated:** 2026-10-29  
**Purpose:** Single day-to-day source of truth. Update this file whenever work starts, finishes, is blocked, or changes scope. Do not restart from a different milestone without recording why.

## Rules for every work session

- [ ] Read this checklist and `docs/18-phase-wise-delivery-roadmap.md` before changing code.
- [ ] Continue from **Current checkpoint** below; do not silently jump to mobile, marketing extras, or another milestone.
- [ ] Keep the five themes (Light, Midnight, Graphite, Forest, AMOLED Black) and System default intact.
- [ ] Preserve existing working routes and features; inspect code and contracts before changing them.
- [ ] Do not call a feature complete until implementation, tests, and applicable browser/API verification support that claim.
- [ ] After each meaningful task, update this file with commit SHA, checks actually run, remaining blockers, and the next exact task.

## Current checkpoint — continue here

**Active milestone:** Web marketplace (M2 / roadmap Phase 1), after marketplace-first homepage/navigation and API deployment fixes.

**Last known completed work**
- [x] Reframed the homepage as a property marketplace rather than a generic agency/portfolio landing page.
- [x] Reordered primary navigation around Home, Buy, Rent, All properties, Saved, and My listings.
- [x] Added responsive marketplace-first homepage styles while preserving the existing global stylesheet and theme system.
- [x] Fixed production NestJS startup to resolve the compiled entrypoint.
- [x] Latest reported Render deployment is Live; latest reported GitHub CI and Quality Checks passed on commit `884b04b3d7aea6eb013a46ac6393a138902b5d00`.
- [x] User confirmed API health and readiness are ready (user confirmation; not independently re-run in this session).

**Immediate next task (do this before moving to another milestone)**
- [ ] Fix and verify the homepage search controls: Buy/Rent tabs must carry the selected transaction into search; category links and form values must match the actual API category/search contract; commercial must not silently become an unsupported/empty filter.
- [ ] Inspect backend DTOs, property category model, and search service before deciding how category filtering should be represented.
- [ ] Run relevant typecheck/build/tests and record actual results.

## Milestone status

### M0 — Product/technology decisions
- [x] React Native Community CLI selected for the eventual mobile app.
- [x] NestJS + TypeScript API selected.
- [x] Next.js web and dedicated admin selected.
- [x] Clerk selected; exact sign-in methods still need confirmation before auth implementation.
- [x] MongoDB selected; Cloudinary selected for intended listing media.
- [x] Free launch; payment collection remains disabled.

### M1 — Foundation and CI
- [x] Workspace and app scaffolding.
- [x] API health and MongoDB readiness routes.
- [x] CI and Quality Checks were reported green for the latest startup-fix commit.
- [x] Render API deployment reported Live.
- [ ] Verify the exact deployed health/readiness endpoints again if deployment/runtime changes.
- [ ] Confirm environment validation and setup docs remain complete.
- [ ] Do not mark the whole product production-ready based on CI or API liveness alone.

### M2 — Web marketplace experience (ACTIVE)
- [x] Marketplace-first homepage and primary navigation pass.
- [x] Responsive CSS pass for new homepage.
- [ ] Homepage Buy/Rent tabs and search form state work together.
- [ ] Category/type values are compatible with the backend contract.
- [ ] Real API-backed search, filters, sort, pagination verified end-to-end.
- [ ] Property details use live API data and correct loading/empty/error/not-found states.
- [ ] Listing form create/preview/publish flow is API-backed.
- [ ] My Listings supports real user-owned listings and lifecycle actions.
- [ ] Saved properties behavior is defined and persistence requirements are met.
- [ ] Profile/account workflows are functional.
- [ ] All relevant routes tested at mobile, tablet, desktop.
- [ ] Compare implemented screens with approved Figma; do not claim parity before review.

### M3 — Backend domain and identity
- [ ] Inspect/confirm domain APIs, DTO validation, consistent error/pagination contracts.
- [ ] Clerk token verification and user/profile sync.
- [ ] Server-side roles/permissions and ownership checks.
- [ ] Property/category/user/favorite/contact/report domains implemented and tested.
- [ ] Integration tests cover success, validation failure, unauthorized access, and ownership denial.

### M4 — Admin and moderation
- [ ] Server-protect admin routes and every privileged API.
- [ ] Users, listings, categories, reports, moderation, configuration, audit trail.
- [ ] Verify non-admin access is denied server-side.
- [ ] Destructive actions have confirmation and audit reason.

### M5 — SEO
- [ ] Titles/descriptions/canonicals/social metadata.
- [ ] Sitemap, robots, accurate structured data, breadcrumbs, clean shareable property URLs.
- [ ] Public routes indexable; private/account/admin routes excluded.
- [ ] Performance and Search Console readiness.

### M6 — Security/reliability
- [ ] DTO/upload validation, secure headers, CORS allowlist, rate limits, abuse protection.
- [ ] IDOR/BOLA, role escalation, mass assignment, injection, upload abuse tests.
- [ ] Secrets hygiene, redacted logs, request IDs, monitoring, backup/restore.
- [ ] Privacy/terms/safety copy reviewed before launch.

### M7 — SaaS entitlements
- [ ] Configurable plans, feature keys, quotas and server-side enforcement.
- [ ] All users assigned Free at launch.
- [ ] Payment collection remains disabled unless explicitly approved.

### M8 — MongoDB/Cloudinary integration
- [ ] Schemas/indexes and repository integration verified against real MongoDB.
- [ ] Cloudinary uploads use server-authorized flow; validate type, size, ownership, cleanup.
- [ ] Integration tests cover unavailable DB, upload failure, duplicates and cleanup.
- [ ] Readiness reflects database connection, not only HTTP process liveness.

### M9 — Release QA
- [ ] End-to-end buyer, owner/broker, and admin journeys pass.
- [ ] Accessibility, theme, responsive, SEO, performance, privacy and security review.
- [ ] Staging smoke test, monitoring, backups, rollback plan.
- [ ] Production readiness signed off only with evidence.

### M10 — Native mobile (LAST)
- [ ] Start only after web, backend, admin, SEO, security, entitlements, and media/data integration gates are accepted.
- [ ] Complete React Native Community CLI Android/iOS projects and core marketplace journeys.
- [ ] Verify five themes plus System and device/emulator behavior.
